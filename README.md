[Receiving notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-apps/enabling-and-receiving-notifications)

Independent watchOS app with an iOS app

Because the app may not be installed on both devices, you should always send the notification to both iPhone and Apple Watch. The system ensures that the user only receives one notification at the best destination.
